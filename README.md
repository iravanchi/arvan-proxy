[Arvan Cloud](https://arvancloud.com/) is an emerging cloud provider quickly building up its product portfolio.

This project, **arvan-proxy**, is a .NET Core web API proxy implementation that makes using Arvan Cloud API as simple as a method invocation. This is a work in progress,
but it is planned to support the following products of Arvan Cloud in this library:

* DNS - Cloud-based domain name servers
* CDN - Cloud-based content delivery network
* Cloud Security - DDoS protection, web application firewall (WAF)
* Cloud Compute - the Infrastructure as a Service offering
* Cloud Storage - the cloud-based object storage
* VoD - Cloud-based video-on-demand platform
* Live Stream - Cloud-based live video streaming with built-in CDN

Using this library, you can program all features available through the web-based management pages. You can provision new servers, store and retrieve data on the
cloud storage, or setup a live video stream, all with a few lines of code in any .NET language. Take a look at [Examples](https://github.com/iravanchi/arvan-proxy/wiki/Examples)
page to see how.
